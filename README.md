# Python_Api_Project
The purpose of this project was to extract weather data from API's, model then visualize the data, and form conclusions for global weather trends. 
This project involved using the OpenWeather API to gather data from over 500 cities world wide. Matplotlib was then used to visualize the extracted data, followed by a regression analysis on each plot as well. The main challenge of this project was determining proper API documentation, indexing through json files, and extracting the data to be put into arrays for proper plotting. Following the modelling of the data, a heat map with interactive markers was created in order to isolate the cities with the ideal weather conditions. 

The plots created were :\
-Temperature (F) vs. Latitude\
-Humidity (%) vs. Latitude\
-Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude\
-Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude\
-Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude\
-Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude\
-Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude\
-Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude\
-Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude\
-Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude\
-Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude\
-Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude\
-a map with filtered cities with ideal weather conditions ( labels on each city with additional information were included as well )
